# Mini-project-Guess-the-number-
I created a "Guess the Number" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players guess a randomly generated number within a set range, receiving feedback on their guesses. This project demonstrates basic web development skills and user interaction through DOM manipulation.
